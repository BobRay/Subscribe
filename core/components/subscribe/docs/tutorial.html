<p>Subscribe provides a double-opt-in User registration system. It uses some parts of the Login package, so be sure the Login package is installed before using Subscribe.</p>

<div class="box">
<p><b>Important Upgrade Note!</b></p>

<p>A number of element and directory names have changed and quite a few internal changes were made to make Subscribe easier to configure and to avoid conflicts with other extras. All of the default chunks and snippets have been renamed.</p>

<p>Since everything was changing, I took the opportunity to refactor Subscribe from the ground up to streamline the code and, hopefully, make it easier to use and configure.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from version 1.1.0 and have made changes to the default Tpl chunks, be sure to back them up so you'll have them for reference, then uninstall and remove the Subscribe package before downloading and installing the new version.
</p>
<p>
When upgrading from 1.1.0, you'll also need to create a Manage Preferences Resource and set the Subscribe System Settings as described below.
</p>

<p>All &quot;sm&quot; and &quot;Sm&quot; prefixes have been changed to &quot;sbs&quot; and &quot;Sbs&quot; to avoid conflicts with other extras. If you've created a custom CSS file be sure to back it up outside the subscribe directory. Any resources you created will be unchanged, but you may need to alter their content a little. I apoligize for the inconvenience. Future upgrades should go much more smoothly.</p>

<h3>About Subscribe</h3>
<p>Subscribe provides a request-to-subscribe message that will appear on pages at your site. When Users choose to subscribe and submit the registration form, they receive an email message with a link to confirm their registration. The request-to-subscribe message will not be shown to Users who are logged in (they will see a logout link). You can also hide the request-to-subscribe message on selected pages with the <fixedpre>&noShows</fixedpre> property in the SubscribeRequest snippet tag.</p>
        
<p>As soon as a User submits the Registration form, a User record and a User Profile for the User are saved in the MODX database, but with the User marked as inactive. When the User responds by clicking on the link in the email, they are taken to the site, marked as active, logged in, and sent to a &quot;Registration Confirmed&quot; page (or another page of your choice).</p>
        
<p>The default registration form also includes the option of checkboxes for the User to indicate interests. The User's interests will be saved as a comma-separated list in the <fixedpre>comment</fixedpre> field of the User's Profile (or, optionally, in an extended field of your choice). This allows you to send email messages to Users based on their interests (an upcoming version of EmailResource will do this automatically as will an upcoming extra called &quot;Notify&quot;). You can also design systems that respond to User interests by customizing menus, forwarding Users to particular parts of the site on login, etc.</p>

<p>There is also a Manage Preferences form that lets the user change their interests at any time. It also allows the user to unsubscribe.</p>

<h3>Installing Subscribe</h3>

<p>
Go to System | Package Management on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport Facility). Put Subscribe in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button, and when it changes to "Downloaded," click on the "Finish" button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the "Install" button next to Subscribe in the grid. The Subscribe package should now be installed.</p>

<p>If you have not installed the Login package, do that before continuing.</p>


<h3>Creating the Subscribe Resources</h3>

<p>All resources used in the Subscribe package should be published and hidden from menus (unless you want to show a link to the Register page in a menu).</p>

<p>Create a Resource called Thank You for Registering. Make it published but hidden from menus. Put something like this in the Resource Content field:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
<p>
Thanks for registering. You will receive an email message soon
containing a link that will activate your subscription. Please
click on the link in the message to become an active subscriber.
</p>
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Make a note of the Thank You page's ID once you have saved it.</p>

<p>Create a resource called Registration Confirmed. This is the page users will see when they click on the link in the email message. Make it published but hidden from menus. Put something like the following in the Resource Content field:
</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
    <p>Congratulations, you are now a subscriber!</p>
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>The User should be logged in automatically when they confirm registration.</p>

<p>Make a note of the ID of your Registration Confirmed page.</p>

<p>Create a Resource called Confirm Register. This is the page that actually processes the user when they click on the link in the email message. The user will never see this page. The snippet on the page marks them as an active user, logs them in, and forwards them to the &quot;Registration Confirmed&quot; page. Make sure this resource is published but hidden from menus. Put only this code in the Resource Content field. Replace ## with the ID of your Registration Confirmed page (*not* the Confirm Register page).</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
[[!ConfirmRegister?
    &redirectTo=`##`
    &errorPage=`[[++site_start]]`
]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Create a Resource called Register (or Subscribe). Make sure it is published. This page contains the Registration form.  Put something like this in the Resource Content field.</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
    <p>Please fill out the following form and submit it to become a subscriber:</p>

[[$SbsRegisterFormTpl]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Create a Resource called Manage Preferences. Make sure it is published. This page will allow users to change the tags that show their preferences. It also contains an unsubscribe feature that changes the user's status from active to inactive. Unsubscribed users retain their username, password, and preferences, and can be simply by changing their status back to active.</p>
<p>
Put this code in the Resource Content field of the Manage Preferences Resource:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
<p>Submit the form below to manage your preferences or unsubscribe:</p>
[[$SbsManagePrefsFormTpl]]
</fixedpre></pre>


<p>Put the following tag in the <fixedpre><body></fixedpre> section of any templates for pages that should show the request-to-subscribe. In the <fixedpre>&noShows</fixedpre> property, put a comma-separated list containing the IDs of other pages where the request should not be shown. By default, the request is not shown on the Login, Registration, Thanks for Registering, and Confirm Registration pages. Add the IDs of any other pages it should not be shown on to the <fixedpre>&noShows</fixedpre> property in the snippet tag in the template. The tag will be replaced by the &quot;Request to Subscribe&quot; message (which appears horizontally on a single line) for users who are not logged in and by the &quot;Logout&quot; link for users who are logged in.</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
[[!SbsSubscribe]]

or

[[!SubscribeRequest
    &noShows=`##,##,##`
]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<h3>Subscribe System Settings</h3>
<p>Once you have created the resources, it's time to set the Subscribe System Settings. In the current version, rather than setting properties in multiple places, you only need to set the basic system settings and they'll be used by all parts of the subscribe package. They can be overridden by properties in the Subscribe snippet tags, but you should rarely, if ever, need to do that.</p>

<p>Go to System | System Settings in the MODX Manager. Using the drop-down list that says &quot;core&quot; (in the center, just above the grid), change the setting to &quot;subscribe&quot; (it may be on page two of the list). Once you've done that, you should see just the Subscribe settings. </p>

<p>To set each setting, right-click on it and select &quot;Update Setting&quot;. Don't change anything but the &quot;value&quot; field. Set all of the five settings with page IDs in their names to the appropriate Resource IDs. You'll see these in parentheses in the Resource tree at the left. The other settings are optional and can be left alone. After changing each setting, be sure to click on the &quot;Save&quot; button (not &quot;Close&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;). Before leaving, check the settings in the grid and make sure all five page IDs are set properly.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>


<p>Before testing, clear the cache and make sure that the following resources are published and hidden from menus (unless you want to show the Register page in the menu).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Register</li>
    <li>Confirm Register</li>
    <li>Registration Confirmed</li>
    <li>Thank You for Registering pages</li>
    <li>Manage Preferences</li>
</ul>


<p>Test your system by visiting the site from another browser where you are not logged in to the Manager. When you are logged in to the Manager and are previewing the site, your login status is ambiguous. You're logged in, but not to the 'web' context, so Subscribe's login status checks can give odd results.</p>

<p>It's recommended that you test the system with the settings above before modifying it to meet your needs. Go to the Register page and register as a new User. See if you get the email and, if so, use the link in the email to confirm the registration. You should end up on the Registration Confirmed page. If that doesn't all happen, check the publication status of the resources -- all should be published. If they are, check the various Resource IDs used in the tags in all the Subscribme Resources and Chunks.</p>

<p>Next, log in to the Manager. Check to make sure that the new User exists and is active. Check the <fixedpre>comment</fixedpre> field of the User Profile to make sure that the interests are recorded there. Delete the User.</p>

<h3>Customizing Subscribe</h3>

<p>To set the interests checkboxes on the Register form Edit the checkboxes at the end of the SbsRegisterFormTpl chunk to use any tags you want. You can add or delete checkboxes to meet your needs, but leave the hidden one at the beginning. When changing the name of an interest, be sure to change both the value and the visible HTML. In The code for each checkbox, the &quot;value&quot; part is what will be saved to the User Profile. The visible part (the one on the right) is what the User will see when filling out the form. It's recommended that you leave no spaces in the &quot;value&quot; part and that you make it all lowercase.
</p>
        
<p>There is JavaScript validation for all fields in the Register form. All fields are required. The Username and Password fields are required to be at least 6 characters long and the two Password fields must match. The Email field is also checked to make sure it's a valid address. The User must also check at least one of the &quot;Interests&quot; checkboxes.</p>
        
<p>If you don't want to use the interests feature at all, you can delete all the checkboxes, but the JavaScript validation may complain. You can either leave the hidden field and set its value to something, or edit the SbsRegisterJsTpl chunk and remove the check at the end of the code. Be sure not to delete the closing curly brace at the end of the code or the code that follows it. You'll also need to remove the <fixedpre>&postHooks</fixedpre> property from the snippet tag at the top of the SbsRegisterFormTpl chunk, which stores the interests in the database.</p>
        
<h3>Styling the forms</h3>

<p>The &quot;request-to-subscribe&quot; message is styled to be appear on a single horizontal line, but you can restyle it with CSS to appear in another form since the message and all buttons are contained in identifiable span tags. You can also edit the SbsSubscibeTpl chunk, if necessary. The SbsSubScribe snippet replaces the placeholders in the chunk and displays it, so the HTML with the placeholders must remain in that chunk unless you replace the placeholders with your own code.</p>

<p>Both the Register form and the &quot;request-to-subscribe&quot; message can be styled by editing the /assets/components/subscribe/css/subscribe.css file, as can the two popup windows.</p>

<p>I originally had a nice JQuery slider for the two popups, but since they might be loaded for every page on a site, I decided that the speed penalty involved in loading the JQuery core, UI, and CSS files was just not worth it. The popups are now done with CSS and a tiny bit of embedded JavaScript to toggle their visibility. You can modify their position and appearance in the subscribe.css file.</p>

<p>To change the message in the popups, just edit the SbsSubscribeTpl chunk. As currently styled, the popups will automatically expand to match the content length.</p>

<h3>Modfying the CSS</h3>

<p>
If you want to modify the CSS used for Subscribe, it's better to duplicate or rename the subscribe.css file so it won't be overwritten by upgrades:</p>
<pre><fixedpre>
assets/components/subscribe/css/subscribe.css
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>
You can specify your CSS file with the <fixedpre>&cssPath</fixedpre> and <fixedpre>&cssFile</fixedpre> properties. If your CSS file is in same directory as the original (see above), you only need the <fixedpre>&cssFile</fixedpre>property.
</p>

<p>The properties need to go in three places:

<ul>
    <li>The SubscribeRequest snippet tag in your template(s).</li>
    <li>The SubscribeForm snippet tag in the SbsRegisterFormTpl chunk</li>
    <li>The SubscribeForm snippet tag in the SbsManagePrefsFormTpl chunk</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add the CSS to your main CSS file, use <fixedpre>&cssFile=`none`</fixedpre> in all three places and the CSS file will not be loaded.</p>

<h3>Modifying the Tpl Chunks</h3>

<p>
If you want to modify the default Tpl chunks, duplicate them and change the name by adding &quot;My&quot; as a prefix. For the chunks used in the sbsLoggedInDisplayTpl and sbsLoggedOutDisplay (Request to Subscribe), add the appropriate properties below to the SubscribeRequest snippet tag in the template:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
&loggedOutDisplayTpl
&loggedInDisplayTpl
&whyDialogTpl
&whyDialogTextTpl
&privacyDialogTpl
&privacyDialogTextTpl
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>You'll almost certainly want to modify the sbsCheckboxTpl and the sbsPrefListTpl chunks. Before doing that, you'll need to duplicate the sbsRegisterFormTpl and sbsManagePrefsFormTpl chunks, adding &quot;My&quot; as a prefix to their names. In the duplicate chunks,  Add the following properties to the RequestForm snippet tag in both of the duplicate chunks:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
&checkBoxTpl=`MySbsCheckboxTpl`
&prefListTpl=`MySbsPrefListTpl`
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Now duplicate the sbsCheckboxTpl and sbsPrefListTpl chunks and add &quot;My&quot; as a prefix to their names. Then modify them to suit your needs.</p>
