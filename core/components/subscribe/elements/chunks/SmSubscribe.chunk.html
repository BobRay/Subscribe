              <h3>Why Subscribe?</h3>

              <p>As a Subscriber, you will receive access to certain parts 
                 of the site that are hidden from others. You'll also get 
                 email updates when new content is available 
                 on the site or existing content is updated.</p>
              
                 <p>When logged in, you'll no longer see this request to 
                    subscribe.</p>
              
              <p>As an added incentive to subscribe, I have a bunch
                 of new and updated MODX extras I plan to release
                 as soon as I have a significant number of subscribers
                 to notify.</p>

              <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
              <p>I'm too lazy to collect any information about you other
                  than the data you submit when you subscribe, which I will
                  never intentionally share with anyone.</p>

              <p>As usual, Google and other entities may also collect
                  information about you during your visit.</p>

                  <p>If this policy changes, I'll let you know.</p>
