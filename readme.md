Subscribe provides a double-opt-in user subscription system. Users who subscribe are saved as regular users in a specified user group (Subscribers by default).

Subscribe manages registration and lets users set their preferences and (optionally) user group membership.

Subscribe was written as a companion to the [Notify](https://bobsguides.com/notify-tutorial.html) extra, which sends targeted emails about new and updated resources on your site based on group membership and expressed preferences. Notify can also be used to send free-form email messages to selected groups of users.

Subscribe can also be used in conjunction with the [EmailResource](https://bobsguides.com/emailresource-plugin-tutorial.html) package to send any resource on your site as an email to the subscribed users. EmailResource also provides a tag system so that users can specify preferences and interests when they register. Subscribe allows you to send email only to users with specified tags.
