SubscribeMe provides a double-opt-in user subscription system. Users who subscribe are saved as regular users in a specified user group (Subscribers by default).

SubscribeMe can be used in conjunction with the EmailResource package to send any resource on your site as an email to the subscribed users. EmailResource also provides a tag system so that users can specify preferences and interests when they register. SubscribeMe allows you to send email only to users with specified tags.
